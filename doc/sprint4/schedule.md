This sprint consisted of a lot of clean-up work. We cleaned up the code for the front-end, backend and made integrations much more seamless. Alongside with working on the UX to make the application much more user friendly, with calculations being done in a more useful manner.

## How did we manage to keep our sprint on schedule?

We made use of Trelloâ€™s tacking board to keep track of the progress for each user story and who was assigned to complete it. We had regular standups to determine if we had any blockers and redefine our original schedule if required.
