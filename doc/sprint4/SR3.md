## New User Stories from unfinished Sprint 3 Tasks
- N/A

## What are practices that you should continue during next sprint
- Frequent Sprint meetings.
- Frequent communication of progress over Discord text channels/calls.
- Peer review of pull requests.
- Organization through Jira issues (or some other Kanban board equivalent, i.e. Trello).
- Quick distribution of user stories at the beginning of each Sprint.
- Frequent rebasing on feature branches prior to pull request(s) being merged into development branch, to avoid conflict when merging.
- Handling of documentation for any given Sprint at the first standup held, to avoid last minute completion.
- Implementation of some standard for backend structure to avoid last-minute cleanup.
- Addition of ticket numbers to the beginning of commit messages.
- Testing of product a day before deadline.

## What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint 
- Preemptively making branches for each user story (prior to starting the sprint).
- Use PROM-XX: 'commit message here' naming convention when making commits to the repo.
- Putting a strong emphasis on our critical path to clear out important user stories first.

## What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint 
- Last-minute changes to standup times.
- Non-hotfix commits to main (should be only to feature branches, which are then to be merged into development).
- Non-hotfix commits to develop (should also be within its own feature branch)

## Best Experiences of Sprint 3:
- Critical paths handled more properly (almost no blockers from clever planning).
- Distribution of user stories allowed everyone to perform tasks that were the most adequate for them.
- Standups allowed strong syncronization between team members, no arguments at all.
- Frontend was quickly pumped out and made backend much easier to develop (all buttons and pages were readily available).

## Worst Experiences of Sprint 3:
- Last minute completion of documentation for Sprint 2.
- Different stylization (CSS) for different pages in the frontend before conflict resolution. 
- Conflict between styled-components and MUI integration in the frontned.
- Last minute hotfix changes (which weren't tested -> risk of breaking-level features)
