# SR2

## The participants in the meeting 
Maaz Hashmi, Tegh Mehta, Preyansh Dutta, Gabriel Ethan Vainer, Armando Rojas, Alejandro Iglesias Llobet

## New User Stories from unfinished Sprint 2 Tasks
- As a user, I should be able to view courses grouped by the semester they're attached to.

## What are practices that you should continue during next sprint
- Frequent Sprint meetings.
- Frequent communication of progress over Discord text channels/calls.
- Peer review of pull requests.
- Organization through Jira issues (or some other Kanban board equivalent, i.e. Trello).
- Quick distribution of user stories at the beginning of each Sprint.
- Frequent rebasing on feature branches prior to pull request(s) being merged into development branch, to avoid conflict when merging.

## What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint 
- Handling of documentation for any given Sprint at the first standup held, to avoid last minute completion.
- Implementation of some standard for backend structure to avoid last-minute cleanup.
- Addition of ticket numbers to the beginning of commit messages.
- Testing of product a day before deadline.

## What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint 
- Last-minute changes to standup times.
- Non-hotfix commits to main (should be only to feature branches, which are then to be merged into development).

## Best Experiences of Sprint 2:
- Distribution of user stories allowed everyone to perform tasks that were the most adequate for them.
- Backend was easier to develop for than expected.
- Standups allowed strong syncronization between team members, no arguments at all.

## Worst Experiences of Sprint 2:
- Last minute completion of documentation for Sprint 2.
- Different stylization (CSS) for different pages in the frontend before conflict resolution. 
- Conflict between styled-components and MUI integration in the frontned.
