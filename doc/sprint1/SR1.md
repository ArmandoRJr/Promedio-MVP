## New User Stories from unfinished Sprint 1 Tasks
- As a returning User, I want to be able to see, delete and edit my Semesters in some component that appears in the main webpage when I'm logged in.
- As a first-time User, I want to be able to navigate to other sections of the page by clicking components in the navigation bar at the top.

## What are practices that you should continue during next sprint
- Frequent Sprint meetings.
- Frequent communication of progress over Discord text channels/calls.
- Peer review of pull requests.
- Organization through Jira issues (or some other Kanban board equivalent).
- Quick distribution of user stories at the beginning of each Sprint.
- Frequent rebasing on feature branches prior to pull request(s) being merged into development branch, to avoid conflict when merging.


## What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint 
- Handling of documentation for any given Sprint at the first standup held, to avoid last minute completion.
- Implementation of some standard for backend structure to avoid last-minute cleanup.
- Addition of ticket numbers to the beginning of commit messages.
- Testing of product a day before deadline.

# What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint 
- Last-minute changes to standup times.

## Best Experiences of Sprint 1:
- Quick integration and usage of technologies such as React and MongoDB.
- Distribution of user stories allowed everyone to perform tasks that were the most adequate for them.
- Frontend was quick and easy to develop for thanks to React-Router.
- Standups allowed strong syncronization between team members, no arguments at all.
- Given rebasing, no issues were encountered for merging branches.

## Worst Experiences of Sprint 1:
- Last minute completion of documentation for Sprint 1.
- Different stylization (CSS) for different pages in the frontend before conflict resolution.
- Jira (technical) issues proved the dire need for a proper Kanban board to organize epics and tasks.
