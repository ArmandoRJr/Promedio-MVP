## Completed User Stories:

**The user stories we chose to work on (and completed) are the following (with the breakdown and points assigned):**

- (PROM-1) As a user, I should have a landing page where I am welcomed and able to select Login or Signup.
    - Landing page should contain a basic introduction to the application as a whole, including purpose and functionality of the app.
    - Landing page should contain a navigation bar at the top of the screen, with quick access to the login page for returning users and access to the registration page for incoming first-time users.
    - **Points assigned: 5SP**

-  (PROM-2) As a user, I want to be able to signup for an account to save my data. 
    - The signup page should ask the user for their name, email, their current GPA and their password.
    - The signup page should interact with the backend, adding users to the MongoDB database.
    **Points assigned: 10SP**`

-  (PROM-3) As a user, I want to be able to login to my account to access my data. 
    - The login page should only require the email and password of the user to log them in. 
    - The login page should interact with the backend, retrieving user information as required.
    - **Points assigned = 5SP**

- (PROM-4) As a user I should be able to log out of my account if needed.
    - Users can quickly log out through some button in the webpage.
    - **Points assigned = 2SP**

- (PROM-7) As a user, I want to be able to organize my courses by semester so I can see only the courses I have currently. I would be able to create, edit, & delete semesters. 
    - Semesters should pair together courses (to be fully developed in a later sprint) so that the user can categorize them quickly.
    - Some frontend feature, such as a sidebar or a list, will act as the user's main method of interacting with semesters. 
    - **Points assigned = 10SP**

**Spikes Recorded:**
- Team had to use a specific version of Node.js until an error in our dependencies was found.
- Team had discrepancies between the use of Yarn vs. NPM.
- Decisions on which format to use for database (SQL w/PostgreSQL vs. NoSQL w/MongoDB) took away from development time.
- Team took time in syncronizing initial backend/frontend setup .env(iroment) requirements.
- Learning the required technologies was a lengthy process for some members.
- (Technical) issues with Jira resulted in lack of organization during the first half of the sprint.
