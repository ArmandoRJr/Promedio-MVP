# Project Promedio

## Project Objective
To build a website application dedicated to streamlining the calculation of academic performance for courses and semesters as a whole. The website will, at the minimum, aid students (with our current focus being undergraduate students) in forming spreadsheets to assist in:
- Easily calculating and visualizing their current mark (GPA and %) for any given course.
- Estimating the mark they'll need on average to achieve a specific goal.
- Visualizing their current course completion and overall cGPA for any given semester.  

This should allow for a more efficient way of tracking one's progress during the completion of their degree(s). Given the above, one should also be able to interact with a marketplace to obtain existing designs made by other users to adhere to their own plan. 

## Key Personas
- **Persona #1:** Jesse is a smart first-year undergraduate student, currently aiming to complete all necessary courses for his second-year program evaluation, which determines whether he remains at the university. He is currently in his first semester, and is taking 3 courses relevant for his evaluation, and 2 electives.
- **Persona #2:** Walter is a tenured professor in his university's chemistry department. He is currently teaching two different chemistry courses. 
- **Persona #3:** Kim is a third year undergraduate student, currently majoring in law and ethics. She is aiming to attend law school after she finishes her Bachelor's degree.

## Key Scenarios
Given the personas above, the application should be able to handle the following scenarios:
- Jesse should be able to calculate his cGPA for his first semester, alongside being able to track his mark for the 3 courses relevant to his evaluation. This latter tracker should also be open to the addition of more courses that may be important. 
- Needing to achieve a certain GPA for grad school, Kim should be able to track the adequate courses required for law school (regardless of whether that involves all courses in her undergraduate degree, or only a few (e.g. all courses in the last two years)).
- Because of complaints from his previous students on the complexity of his grading schemes, Walter now wishes to release sheets to his classroom that will aid in keeping better track of current progress throughout the two courses that he is teaching 

## Key Design Principles
One of our key principles is accessibility and ease of use. Our goal is to carefully design an UI that will streamline the process of developing tracking tools: one should be able to take a quick look at their course syllabi and finish designing their sheets in a matter of seconds. This UI should accomodate for **all** different types of grading schemes that course instructors may develop for their courses.
It should also be easy to distribute and find existing template sheets within the larger Promedio community/marketplace.
