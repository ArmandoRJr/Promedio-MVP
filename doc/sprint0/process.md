# Process

## Team Organization
### How did you organize the team?
We pre-arranged a team of 6 approximately 2 weeks prior to the start of classes for this semester. We have all been friends throughout the past few semesters, so there were no real issues or conflicts in formulating our group.
### Which tools did you use, if any?
We mainly use Discord as our main form of communcation. We've divided our text channels into sections as follows:
- General - All general discussions regarding the project are here (this is where 85%+ of our communcation takes place)
- Important Stuff - For important announcements, such as the times for which we've agreed upon to meet every week, the official link to our GitHub repository, deadline reminders, etc... 
- Sprints - This is divided into a sub-category for each sprint (i.e. sprint-0). This is where most of our remaining 15%+ of our communcation takes place, usually for discussing important information specific to that specific sprint (i.e. deciding which tasks each member will complete, such as myself \[Alejandro\] tasked with creating this process.md file!)
We've also discussed which tools we plan on using for certain technologies (i.e. Figma for UI design and the MERN stack to abide by the Three-tier Architecture), though this is more relevant for future sprints.

## Decision Making
### How did you make decisions?
Our preferred method of making important decisions is to review them collectively as a group within an online-meeting (via Discord voice chat) or in person (on the UTSC campus). We always plan to collaborate with other group members when making decisions, and plan to follow this methodology for future sprints as well (including the practice of making Pull Requests for others to review). We found this to be advantageous in that this gives us more confidence in the decisions we make and allows for us to be as minimally error-prone as possible.

## Prioritizing User Stories
### How did you define priority and/or points of user stories?
We used the "story points" system as was taught in class with a 20 point range (where a score of 0 points signifies a story is very trivial to complete whilst a score of 20 indicates a story is very difficult to complete and could even take an additional sprint to complete). We began with user stories we found to be quite simple to complete (such as a 'log out' feature) and started assigning story points on a basis reflective to how much more difficult or easier it is to complete relative to the other stories (for which we've already assigned a story-points-based value).
### How many rounds of voting (on average) did you need to come to a consensus for the point estimate?
For the most part, we generally agreed to a consensus for most user stories. We didn't really have many disagreements, in that our story-point evaluations didn't differ in magnitude than by a margin of a few points (i.e. the majority of the group had a similar evaluation for the user stories on a story-points basis). From a technical perspective, we performed an average of **1-2 rounds of voting poker** for each user story (in that any initial disagreement in the evaluation of a user story was often resolved after a small collective discussion/round of "voting poker"). 

## Meetings
### How frequently did you meet?
We have arranged two mandatory meetings every week (Tuesdays 9:30pm-10:00pm and Thursdays 3:00pm-4:00pm) as well as an optional meeting on Sundays. We also have frequent calls together (outside these set-up mandatory/optional meetings), though we technically meet up for a **minimum of 2-3 times per week.**

## Next Phase
### What lessons should you take forward to the next phase?
Make general consensuses early regarding major structural technologies (such as the tech stack and other technologies we want to utilize). We've had a lot of back and forth on some topics, such as deciding whether to use MERN or introduce a python-based backend (Flask or Django) with a relational database management system. This is very good, though we haven't applied this for everything (i.e. we were using npm to install packages such as express and body-parser, and only later on decided to start using yarn). We haven't been abiding towards the "engineers plan and make all the necessary calculations before building a bridge" lesson very well (covered in class), and have definitely realized we should incorporate this later on within our next sprints.
