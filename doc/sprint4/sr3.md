# SR3

## The participants in the meeting 
Maaz Hashmi, Tegh Mehta, Preyansh Dutta, Gabriel Ethan Vainer, Armando Rojas, Alejandro Iglesias Llobet

## What are practices that you should continue during next sprint
- Frequent Sprint meetings.
- Implementation of some standard for backend structure to avoid last-minute cleanup.
- Quick distribution of user stories at the beginning of each Sprint.
- Peer review of pull requests.
- Organization through Jira issues (or some other Kanban board equivalent, i.e. Trello).
- Frequent communication of progress over Discord text channels/calls.
- Frequent rebasing on feature branches prior to pull request(s) being merged into development branch, to avoid conflict when merging.
- Consistent usage of ticket numbers to the beginning of commit messages.

## What are some new practices that you might want to use during next sprint 
- Handling of documentation for any given Sprint at the first standup held, to avoid last minute completion.
- Testing of product multiple days before deadline.

## What are (if any) harmful practices you should stop using during next sprint 
- Last-minute changes to standup times.
- Non-hotfix commits to main (should be only to feature branches, which are then to be merged into development).

## Best Experiences of Sprint 3:
- Communication and chemistry between team members.
- Integration between Frontend and Backend was amazing.
- Distribution of user stories allowed everyone to perform tasks that were the most adequate for them.
- Standups allowed strong syncronization between team members, no arguments at all.

## Worst Experiences of Sprint 3:
- Cleanup of trello board and frontend/backend components.
- Last minute completion of documentation for Sprint 3.
- Conflict between styled-components and MUI integration in the frontend.
